# Uber-trips
Uber has been a major source of travel for people living in urban areas. By analzing Uber trips, we can draw many patterns like which day has the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour for Uber and many other patterns 
The dataset I'm using here is based on Uber trips from New York, a city with a very complex transportation system with a large community.
The dataset contains data of about 4.5 million uber pickups in New York City from April to September.
